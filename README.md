# Bank Management System

A Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project that simulates a bank management system with customers, accounts, and transactions.

## Features

- Customer management
- Multiple account types (Savings and Checking)
- Fund transfers between accounts
- Transaction history
- Interest calculation for savings accounts
- Overdraft protection for checking accounts

## OOP Concepts Demonstrated

1. **Encapsulation**: Private attributes with getter properties
2. **Inheritance**: Account base class with SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount subclasses
3. **Polymorphism**: Different implementations of withdraw() and calculate_interest() methods
4. **Abstraction**: Abstract base class with abstract methods
5. **Composition**: Customer objects containing Account objects
6. **Association**: Transaction objects associated with Account objects
7. **Aggregation**: Bank object containing Customer and Account objects
